This example demonstrates how to use EcPrivateKey and EcPublicKey classes to sign/verify messages.
The signing parameters are compatible with ndn-cxx:commit:d9b083e8253575bd0049d3ca4521a07817d0acf1.
extras/ec-demo.cpp has an ndn-cxx program that generates an EC key and then sign/verify messages.
The sketch and the ndn-cxx program can be used together to check compatibility.
