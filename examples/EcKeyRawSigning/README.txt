This example demonstrates how to use EcKey class to sign/verify messages directly.
The signing parameters are compatible with ndn-cxx:commit:7f01247b5bc75d9416e22828b72976abd57f16a9.
ndn-cxx/ec-demo.cpp has an ndn-cxx program that generates an EC key and then sign/verify messages.
The sketch and the ndn-cxx program can be used together to check compatibility.
